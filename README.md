Some really rough sketches that might be useful?

Check out `api/api.js` for an example express api. I was originally imaginging only reading from the API, which would be easy. This one becomes way more complex if you need to write from the web -- gotta figure out permissions and stuff like that!

Check out `scripts/` for an example of using puppeteer to grab a screenshot. Based on this: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/puppeteer/
